<p>Every player character attack and every enemy attack is represented
as a node in a directed acyclic graph (DAG).<br />
The edge from a node <em>n</em> to another node <em>n’</em> is a
boolean, a truth value, indicating whether <em>n &lt; n’</em> or
not.<br />
Let <strong><em>less(n, n’)</em></strong> be the function denoting this
relationship.<br />
Let <strong><em>C</em></strong> be the set of nodes representing
character attacks, <strong><em>E</em></strong> the set of nodes
representing enemy attacks.<br />
Then, <strong>the stopping condition for a Monte Carlo simulation can be
defined as:</strong><br />

alt="stopping condition" /><br />
In other words, the learning process is over once there is a true edge
between every C node and every E node<br />
(should <em>H(c)</em> and <em>D(e)</em> be equal, it would be the case
that the edge from <em>c</em> to <em>e</em> is true, and the edge from
<em>e</em> to <em>c</em> false, since the interaction would result in a
stagger).</p>
<p><em>M</em> being the number of character attacks, <em>N</em> the
number of enemy attacks, the amount of nodes in the DAG is <em>M +
N</em>.<br />
With the previously assumed data for this system, <em>M + N</em> = 300 +
600 = 900.<br />
The number of edges between nodes is the square of the amount of nodes,
810,000 with our data.</p>
<p><strong>Computationally, this graph of nodes is implemented as a
matrix.</strong> To provide a visual, digestible example, let’s consider
a small subset of this matrix: 3 character attacks and 6 enemy
attacks.<br />
<em>C = {c1, c2, c3}</em><br />
<em>E = {e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6}</em><br />
In the beginning, before any observation, every cell in the matrix,
every edge, is set to false:</p>

</figure>
<p>Then, upon observing the interaction between an element of <em>C</em>
and an element of <em>E</em>, e.g. <em>c2 &lt; e4</em>, knowledge is
updated by applying transitive closure to the relation space.<br />
<strong>This transitive closure can be defined as:</strong><br />
<img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreacardino/Hyperarmour/refs/heads/main/transitive%20closure.svg"
alt="transitive closure" /><br />
The proposition captures all the inferences triggered by discovering
that <em>less(c2, e4)</em> is true:<br />
<strong>1) everything weaker than <em>c2</em> must be weaker than
<em>e4</em></strong><br />
<strong>2) everything stronger than <em>e4</em> must be stronger than
<em>c2</em></strong><br />
<strong>3) everything weaker than <em>c2</em> must be weaker than
everything stronger than <em>e2</em></strong></p>
<p>Suppose that after the final update, this is the ordering
established:<br />
<em>[e1, e2] &lt; c1 &lt; [e3, e4] &lt; [c2, c3] &lt; [e5,
e6]</em><br />
The matrix would then look like this:</p>

</figure>
<p>This matrix satisfies the stopping condition defined above, and the
Monte Carlo simulation returns the number of observations it took to
achieve this fulfillment.</p>
